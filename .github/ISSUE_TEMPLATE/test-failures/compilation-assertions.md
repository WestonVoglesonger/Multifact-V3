**Describe the bug**
Compilation service tests are failing due to assertion errors, indicating mismatches between expected and actual compilation results.

**Affected Tests**
- `test_compile_token_with_dependencies`
- `test_compile_multifact`

**Error Messages**
```
AssertionError: Should have compiled S, C, F in total
AssertionError: assert 'Compiled successfully' == 'Good code'
```

**Root Cause**
The compilation service is not producing the expected results, suggesting:
1. Changes in compilation logic not reflected in tests
2. Dependency resolution issues in compilation
3. Validation criteria mismatches
4. Possible regression in compilation functionality

**To Fix**
1. Review compilation service logic for recent changes
2. Verify dependency resolution algorithm
3. Update test expectations if requirements have changed
4. Add more detailed assertion messages
5. Improve compilation result validation

**Environment**
- Python Version: 3.11.11
- SQLAlchemy Version: Latest
- Test Framework: pytest

**Additional Context**
These failures suggest a potential disconnect between the expected compilation behavior and actual implementation. Need to verify if test expectations or implementation needs adjustment.
